#### Introduction to HTML (15 minutes)

1. **What is HTML?**
   - HyperText Markup Language
   - Not a programming language - it's a markup language
   - Uses tags to structure content

2. **HTML Syntax Basics**
   ```html
   <tagname>Content goes here</tagname>
   ```
   - Opening tags: `<p>`
   - Closing tags: `</p>`
   - Self-closing tags: `<br>` or `<br/>`
#### Hands-On: Creating about.html (20 minutes)

1. **Create a New File**
   - Open text editor
   - Create new file called `about.html`

2. **Basic HTML Structure**
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>About Me</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>About Me</h1>
       <p>My name is [Your Name].</p>
       <p>I am learning to build websites!</p>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

3. **Explain Each Part**
   - `<!DOCTYPE html>` - Tells browser this is HTML5
   - `<html>` - Root element
   - `<head>` - Contains metadata
   - `<title>` - Shows in browser tab
   - `<body>` - Contains visible content
   - `<h1>` - Main heading
   - `<p>` - Paragraph

#### Uploading to Neocities (8 minutes)

1. Save the file locally
2. Go to Neocities dashboard
3. Click "Edit Your Site"
4. Upload the about.html file
5. View the page at username.neocities.org/about.html
