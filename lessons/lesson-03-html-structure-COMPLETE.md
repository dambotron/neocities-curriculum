## PART 1: I DO (Teacher Demonstration) - 15 minutes

### The Complete HTML5 Structure Explained (8 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
"Last class, we wrote basic HTML. Today, we'll understand EVERY line of a professional HTML document. This is like learning the blueprint before building a house!"
**[CREATE NEW FILE and TYPE each line with explanations]**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```
**"Line 1: The DOCTYPE Declaration"**
"This is like putting a sign on your house that says 'Built in 2024 with modern materials!'
- It MUST be the very first line
- It's NOT an HTML tag (notice no closing tag)
- The 'html' part means we're using HTML5 (the newest version)
- Without this, browsers might display your page incorrectly (quirks mode)
- Fun fact: Old HTML4 had DOCTYPE declarations that were 3 lines long!"

```html
<html lang="en">
```
**"Line 2: The Root Element"**
"This is the container that holds EVERYTHING else - like the foundation and walls of your house.
- `<html>` is called the 'root' element
- `lang="en"` tells browsers and screen readers this page is in English
- Why language matters:
  - Screen readers pronounce words correctly
  - Search engines know what language to index
  - Translation tools work better
- Other language codes: 'es' (Spanish), 'fr' (French), 'zh' (Chinese)"

```html
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
```
**"Line 3-4: The Head Section Begins"**
"The head is like the control room of your webpage - users don't see it, but it controls everything!
- `<head>` contains metadata (data about data)
- `<meta charset="UTF-8">` is CRITICAL - here's why:
  - UTF-8 lets you use ANY character from ANY language
  - Includes emojis! ðŸ˜€ hearts â™¥ and symbols Â© â„¢
  - Without it, special characters become weird symbols like Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ or ÃƒÂ©"
```html
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```
**"Line 5: The Viewport Meta Tag"**
"This is the SECRET to making websites look good on phones!
- `width=device-width`: Makes the page match the screen width
- `initial-scale=1.0`: Sets the zoom level (1.0 = 100%, no zoom)
- Without this, mobile browsers assume your site is desktop-only and zoom out
- This is called 'responsive web design' - we'll learn more in later lessons"

```html
    <meta name="description" content="A website about learning HTML">
    <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, web development, learning">
    <meta name="author" content="Your Name">
```
**"Lines 6-8: SEO and Information Meta Tags"**
"These help search engines and social media understand your page:
- `description`: Shows up in Google search results (keep under 160 characters)
- `keywords`: Helps with search (less important now, but good practice)
- `author`: Credits the creator (that's you!)"

```html
    <title>My Awesome Website - Home</title>
</head>
```
**"Lines 9-10: The Page Title"**
"The title is SUPER important - here's everywhere it appears:
- Browser tab (look up there!)
- Bookmarks/favorites
- Search engine results (the blue clickable link)
- Social media when shared
- Best practice: Put site name AND page name"

```html
<body>
    <!-- This is where all visible content goes -->
    <h1>Welcome to My Site</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```**"Lines 11-16: Body and Comments"**
"Everything visible goes in the body, and comments help organize:
- `<!-- -->` creates comments (notes for developers)
- Comments are INVISIBLE on the actual webpage
- Use them to explain complex code or leave reminders"

### HTML Comments Deep Dive (7 minutes)

**[TYPE examples of comments]**

```html
<!-- This is a single line comment -->

<!-- 
    This is a
    multi-line comment
    Great for longer explanations
-->

<!-- TODO: Add more content here -->
<!-- FIXME: This section needs updating -->
<!-- NOTE: This is important -->

<!-- Navigation Section Start -->
<nav>
    <a href="home.html">Home</a>
</nav>
<!-- Navigation Section End -->

<!-- WARNING: Never put passwords or sensitive info in comments! 
     Anyone can view source and see them! -->
```

**Teacher Script:**
"Comments are like sticky notes in your code:
- They help you remember what you were thinking
- They help others understand your code
- They can temporarily 'turn off' code (commenting out)
- Professional developers use LOTS of comments
- But remember: ANYONE can see them with View Source!"

**[DEMONSTRATE: Right-click on any website â†’ View Page Source â†’ Find comments]**

## PART 2: WE DO (Guided Practice) - 20 minutes

### Creating a Professional Template Together (10 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
"Let's build a professional HTML template you can reuse for EVERY project. Follow along with me!"

**Step 1: Create the File**
"Everyone:
1. Open your text editor
2. Create a new file
3. Save it as `template.html`
4. CHECKPOINT: Everyone saved? Show me thumbs up!"

**Step 2: Build the Structure Together**

"Type exactly what I type. I'll explain each line as we go:"

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- 
    Website: My Personal Site
    Author: [Your Name]
    Date Created: [Today's Date]
    Description: Template for all my web pages
-->
```
"Start with DOCTYPE, then add a comment block with information about your file. Fill in your actual name and today's date!"

```html
<html lang="en">
```
"Add the html tag with language. What language code would we use for Spanish class websites? Right - 'es'!"

```html
<head>
    <!-- Character encoding for universal text support -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
```
"Indent with TAB. Add charset with a comment explaining why."
```html
    <!-- Mobile responsive viewport -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    
    <!-- SEO Meta Tags -->
    <meta name="description" content="Add page description here">
    <meta name="keywords" content="add, your, keywords, here">
    <meta name="author" content="Your Name">
    
    <!-- Page Title - Shows in browser tab -->
    <title>Page Title | Site Name</title>
    
    <!-- Future CSS link will go here -->
    <!-- <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> -->
</head>
```
"Add all the meta tags. Notice I'm adding comments for EVERYTHING - this helps you remember what each line does!"

```html
<body>
    <!-- Header Section -->
    <header>
        <h1>Page Title</h1>
        <!-- Future navigation will go here -->
    </header>
    
    <!-- Main Content Section -->
    <main>
        <p>Page content goes here.</p>
    </main>
    
    <!-- Footer Section -->
    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2024 Your Name. All rights reserved.</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```
"The body has three sections: header, main, and footer. Notice the `&copy;` - that's an HTML entity for the Â© symbol!"

**Step 3: Save and Test**
"Save your file and open it in the browser. You should see a basic but professional page structure!"
### Using Browser Developer Tools (10 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
"Professional web developers use DevTools every day. Let me show you this superpower!"

**[OPEN template.html in Chrome/Firefox]**

**Step 1: Opening DevTools**
"Three ways to open Developer Tools:
1. Right-click anywhere â†’ Inspect
2. Press F12
3. Press Ctrl+Shift+I (Cmd+Option+I on Mac)
EVERYONE try all three methods!"

**Step 2: Exploring the Elements Panel**
"Look at the Elements panel (or Inspector in Firefox):
- See the HTML structure as a tree
- Click the arrow to expand/collapse sections
- Hover over HTML to highlight it on the page
- Notice our comments do NOT appear in the rendered page"

**Step 3: Live Editing**
"Watch this magic:
1. Double-click on the h1 text in DevTools
2. Change it to something else
3. Press Enter
4. Look at the page - it changed!
5. Refresh the page - it's back to normal!
This is ONLY temporary - great for testing!"

**Step 4: Finding Hidden Information**
"In DevTools, look at the <head> section:
- All our meta tags are there
- The title element is there
- But users never see any of this on the page!"

**Common DevTools Tips:**
- "Use the magnifying glass to select elements on the page"
- "The Styles panel shows CSS (we'll use this next week)"
- "Console panel shows errors (red text = problem in your code)"
- "Network panel shows loading (useful for images later)"

## PART 3: YOU DO (Independent Practice) - 10 minutes

### Student Activity: Create Your Contact Page

**Instructions:**
"Using your template.html as a starting point, create a professional contact.html page. You have 10 minutes to complete the required tasks."

**Required Tasks:**
1. âœ… Copy template.html and rename it to contact.html
2. âœ… Update the title to "Contact Me | [Your Name]'s Site"
3. âœ… Change the meta description to describe your contact page
4. âœ… Update the h1 to say "Get In Touch"
5. âœ… Add at least 3 different contact methods using appropriate HTML
6. âœ… Add comments to organize your sections
7. âœ… Include at least 3 HTML entities (&copy;, &amp;, &hearts;, etc.)
8. âœ… Add a "business hours" or "availability" section
9. âœ… Test in browser and use DevTools to inspect

**Bonus Challenges:**
- Add a comment that won't show on the page with a secret message
- Use nested comments to organize complex sections
- Add all possible meta tags we discussed
- Create sections for social media links (we'll make them work in Lesson 5)

## Teacher Notes & Tips

### Common Student Errors:
1. **Forgetting DOCTYPE** - Check EVERY file starts with it
2. **Wrong meta tag format** - They're self-closing, no </meta>
3. **Comments inside comments** - This breaks! Show example
4. **Missing viewport** - Their sites won't work on phones
5. **Wrong quote types** - Must use straight quotes " not curly "
### Differentiation Strategies:

**For Struggling Students:**
- Provide printed template with fill-in-the-blanks
- Highlight required vs optional elements
- Create a checklist they can check off
- Pair with stronger student for DevTools section

**For Advanced Students:**
- Research additional meta tags (Open Graph for social media)
- Add microdata or schema.org markup
- Create a template with CSS link prepared
- Explore HTML validation at validator.w3.org

### Time Management:
- 0-5 min: Review homework and warm-up
- 5-15 min: I DO demonstration
- 15-35 min: WE DO template creation
- 35-45 min: YOU DO contact page
- 45-50 min: Assessment and homework

### Key Points to Emphasize:
- DOCTYPE must be first (no blank lines before it!)
- Meta charset prevents character encoding issues
- Viewport is essential for mobile devices
- Comments help but are visible to anyone
- Templates save time and prevent errors

### Extension Ideas:
- Create templates for different page types
- Research HTML entities and create a reference sheet
- Explore other language codes beyond "en"
- Learn about Open Graph meta tags for social sharing

### Resources:
- HTML Entity Reference: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp
- Meta Tag Generator: https://metatags.io/
- HTML Validator: https://validator.w3.org/
- Language Codes: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp
